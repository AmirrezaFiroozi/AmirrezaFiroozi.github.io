title: A soldier who became immortal
---

A decade of slaughter began in 2010, a cruel war between a poor, underdeveloped yet united nation and a resource-consuming beast, for the beast required a wider land so it could tap more resources.

In the seventh year of the war, a true human and a brave young soldier, Iro, stood up to protect his beloveds, his family and children and the innocent people who were being put to death because of the raging thirst of an inbred murderer for blood.

Iro fought the injustice for four years until the day of his immortality came. He got head-injured after an aerial bombardment on the last day of the war, and was moved to a hospital far from the warzone. There the surgeon successfully removed the remains of the bombs that were stuck in the temporal lobe of his brain, but unfortunately he couldn't recover from the injury and was pronounced brain dead.

It was when the hospital staff found his key to immortality, his donor card. Iro's body parts not only enabled him to live forever, they also gave life to people who would have died otherwise.

Of all the things he did, sacrificing one's own organs to save people requires a great special kind of bravery not every one of us possesses...
