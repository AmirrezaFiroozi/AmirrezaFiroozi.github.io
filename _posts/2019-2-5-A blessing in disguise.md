title: A blessing in disguise

   On thursday, April 12, 2013 the fortunate Lissa Miller's life was saved miraculously by being late for interview. 
This is how she narrates her tale, shocking the journalist Joe Doe:

   I had arranged an appointment with Mr. Sawyer who later employed me as a jounior software developer for the Alphabat company; hence, The night before the accident, after checking that everything was in its order, I went to bed early.
  
   The next morning, I was disappointed, for my car didn't start up for unknown reasons; thus, I had to walk to the nearest bus stop which was about half a mile away from my house.
  
   By the time I arrived at the bus stop, the bus had already left and I was about to be late for my inteview with Mr. Sawyer. Luckily, I was able to catch a cab fairly soon.
  
   What I saw on the way to the company from a considerable distance was really painful to watch. A group of teenagers who were on drugs collided with the bus in which I was supposed to be and their car smashed to pieces.
Unfortunately, there was a lot of damage to the bus and it caused it to burn away quickly in seconds which lead to a massive explosion.
  
   Sometimes, I can't avoid thinking what would have happened had I been walking quickly enough to catch the bus...
